        Build an accordion
        components with one or more expandable sections, help save space in UI design. If you’re working on the front
        end of an application, you’ll use accordions a lot. For this challenge, your accordion will accept a list and
        render it. The content in your list will include a title, a body, and an icon to open and close the accordion.
        You’ll use ng-content, @Input(), ngFor, and dynamic class binding, and you’ll also implement a click handler.

                    Build a credit card formatter <br>
                    If you’re working with large numbers, like credit cards that have 16 digits, it’s easier for people
                    to read them when they’re formatted. So for this challenge, try creating a pipe in Angular that will
                    take a credit card number as a string and return the number with dashes between each set of
                    characters. Only consider 16-digit numbers as valid and place the dash between every four digits.
                    Your code should return an error if a number was entered that doesn’t have 16 characters. For this
                    challenge, you will use @Pipe() and PipeTransform.
